# First Impression

This is an exercise to condense a quick summary of the first impression about the project or initiative, once compiled and shared via an issue in the Meeting point repo.

## Why?

- It's an agile way **for the author** to evaluate and capture the resulting impression, so that it can be retrieved later.
- Doing it openly enables sharing the impression **with others**, inviting conversation, either to discuss one's opinions or to point out material that has been overlooked or misunderstood.

The format is designed to be short and direct. 

Please do not interpret it as an attack on the proposal but as a reference to a reflection that can be discussed constructively later in the same issue.
